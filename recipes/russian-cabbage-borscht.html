        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe is a traditional Russian red borscht soup loaded with potatoes, vegetables, cabbage and beets. This hearty soup is so healthy and all the vegetables come together and taste wonderful.</p>
        <p>In most Slavic homes, this soup, a perfect representation of a "less is more" mentality and the love affair the Eastern European cooks had with all things sweet and sour, is served on a regular basis.</p>
