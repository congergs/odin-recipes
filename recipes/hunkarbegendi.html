        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Lamb Stew</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt your butter over a medium heat in large saucepan.</li>
            <li>Now add your lamb and stir it round until it starts to brown.</li>
            <li>Once your lamb is browned all over, add your onion and garlic and stir.</li>
            <li>Cook for 5 minutes or so, until your onion starts to sweat.</li>
            <li>Now add your chopped tomatoes, tomato paste and one cup of hot water.</li>
            <li>Stir everything together.</li>
            <li>Add your thyme/oregano, salt & pepper and stir.</li>
            <li>Once your stew is simmering, put a lid on the pan and turn the heat to low.</li>
            <li>Simmer your stew for around 1 hour, until the lamb has softened and your sauce has thickened.</li>
            <li>Remove from the heat and make your "beğendi" purée…</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Beğendi</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 240 degrees.</li>
            <li>Prick your aubergines with a sharp knife and place on a baking tray in the centre of the oven.</li>
            <li>Bake the aubergines until they are soft to touch (around 15-20 minutes).</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and leave them to cool.</li>
            <li>Once cooled, make a slit along the length of each aubergine.</li>
            <li>Scrape out the pulp with a teaspoon.</li>
            <li>Discard the skins and as many of the seeds as possible.</li>
            <li>Chop up the pulp.</li>
            <li>Now melt your butter in a saucepan over a medium heat.</li>
            <li>Once melted, gradually add your flour, stirring continuously with a wooden spoon.</li>
            <li>After you've added all your flour, your mixture will be relatively solid and now you can start to add your milk.</li>
            <li>Add your milk a little at a time, again, stirring continuously so that the mixture remains smooth.</li>
            <li>Keep going until you have used up all of your milk and you have a smooth, milky mixture.</li>
            <li>Keep stirring and after a couple of minutes, you will notice the sauce start to thicken.</li>
            <li>Once the sauce has started to thicken, add your aubergine. Keep stirring, gently.</li>
            <li>Now add your grated cheese and keep stirring until your beğendi sauce has thickened enough to make a suitable nest for your lamb.</li>
            <li>To serve, share the beğendi sauce between your plates, making a little nest in the centre of each.</li>
            <li>Now spoon the lamb stew into the nest and allow the sauces to run over the aubergine puree.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the parsley over the lamb and serve up your Sultan's Delight.</li>
